# How to play "Find The Rabbit"
## What you'll need

### Playing on desktop
Since its cryptocurrency you will make your bets with, you will need a browser plugin that will help operate with the tokens and sign transactions. We personally recommend [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/). Or you can use any other Dapp compatible plugin to your tasting.

If you follow our recommendations, **install the plugin to your browser** and **create an account there**.

### Playing on mobile platform
If you are more of a mobile gaming guy, please use the [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/) app.

## How to play
